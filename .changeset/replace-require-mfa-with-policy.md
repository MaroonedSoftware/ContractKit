**Breaking:** Replace the `requireMfa: boolean` field in `security: { ... }` blocks with `policy: <ident|none>`, and switch the generated Koa router middleware from `requireSecurity` to ServerKit's new `requirePolicy`.

The `security` declaration on operations, routes, and the file-level `options { security: { ... } }` block no longer accepts a `requireMfa:` line. The new field is `policy:` and takes a bare identifier (the named policy) or the keyword `none` to explicitly bypass policy enforcement. Existing `.ck` files that use `requireMfa:` will fail to parse.

```ck
# Before
security: {
    requireMfa: true
}

# After
security: {
    policy: paymentsWrite
}

# Explicit bypass
security: {
    policy: none
}
```

**`@contractkit/core`** — `SecurityFields` interface drops `requireMfa` / `requireMfaDescription` and adds `policy?: string | false` / `policyDescription?: string`. The grammar's `SecurityRequireMfaLine` is replaced by `SecurityPolicyLine` (`policyKw ":" (noneKw | identifier)`). `security: none` (the route-level public sentinel) is unchanged.

**`@contractkit/plugin-typescript`** — Generated Koa routers now import `requirePolicy` from `@maroonedsoftware/koa` (previously `requireSecurity`) and emit `requirePolicy({ policy: 'name' })`, `requirePolicy({ policy: false })`, or bare `requirePolicy()`. Consumers must upgrade ServerKit alongside.

**`@contractkit/prettier-plugin`** — Formats `policy: <name>` and `policy: none` lines inside security blocks. Files containing `requireMfa:` will no longer round-trip and will surface as parse errors.

**`@contractkit/plugin-markdown`** — The "Security: authenticated" admonition now shows `policy: <name|none>` instead of `requireMfa: <bool>`.

**`@contractkit/openapi-to-ck`** — Non-empty OpenAPI `security` requirements continue to collapse to an empty `security: {}` (authenticated, default policy); the serializer now emits `policy:` lines when the field is set.

**`contractkit-vscode-extension`** — TextMate grammar highlights `policy:` inside the security block; LSP completion offers `policy` instead of `requireMfa`. Re-run `pnpm run vscode:install` to pick up the change.
