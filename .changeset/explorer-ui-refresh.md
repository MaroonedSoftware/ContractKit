Add `resolveEffectiveFields` and `buildModelIndex` to `@contractkit/core` for flattening multi-base inheritance into a fully-resolved field list. The explorer UI gains `renderSchemaTree` and `renderCodeSamples` for structured request/response rendering with deterministic curl + JSON examples, a two-column operation layout with a right rail, faker-seeded Try-It pre-fill, and a file-level preview page. The VS Code extension follows the active `.ck` editor with a new live preview panel, gates its tree view on detected ContractKit projects, and supports multiple preview tabs for pinned items.
