Add a collapsible "Endpoints by area" list to the API Overview page. Each operation renders as a row with its method badge, route, and optional human-readable name; areas auto-expand when there are three or fewer. In the VS Code extension, clicking a row opens that operation in its own preview panel via a new `openOperation` webview message.
