Replace per-operation `pluginFiles` with structured `pluginExtensions`. The `plugins:` block on an operation now accepts JSON-like values (string, number, boolean, null, object, array) so each plugin owns its own schema for its entry. `file://` URLs in any string position are resolved relative to the `.ck` source file before plugins run, and `http://` / `https://` URLs are fetched via GET. `op.pluginExtensions` carries the resolved tree; the raw form lives at `op.plugins`. The Bruno plugin now expects `{ template: "file://..." }` (was a bare path string) and ships a `validateBrunoExtension` hook that fails compilation on unknown fields or non-string `template`.

Plugins can now implement `validateExtension(value)` on the `ContractKitPlugin` interface to surface compilation-time errors/warnings on their entry.

All CLI caching is unified under `<rootDir>/.contractkit/cache/` via a new `CacheService` class: `build.json` for file/plugin hashes and `http/<sha256(url)>` for fetched HTTP response bodies. The `cache: string` config field is reinterpreted as a custom cache **directory** (was a custom build-cache filename); previous file paths under `.contractkit-cache` and `.contractkit-http-cache/` are abandoned. Add `.contractkit/` to `.gitignore`.
