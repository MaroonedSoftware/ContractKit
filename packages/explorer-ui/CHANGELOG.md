### Minor Changes

- af1a6c0: Add an API Explorer to the VS Code extension and a new shared rendering package.

    The extension now contributes an **API Explorer** tree view to the Explorer view container, listing every endpoint and model across the workspace's `.ck` files. Clicking a node opens a Stoplight-style detail panel beside the editor with description, parameters, request and response schemas, security badges, and plugin extensions. Model refs inside operations expand inline as collapsible blocks with cycle detection. Every section has a jump-to-source button.

    Adjacent capabilities:
    - **Filter & grouping** — title-bar buttons for case-insensitive filtering and switching between `file` / `area` / `method` / `flat` grouping (persisted per workspace).
    - **Right-click actions** on tree nodes — Reveal in Editor, Copy Path, Copy as cURL.
    - **Markdown rendering** in operation/model/field descriptions and in tree tooltips.
    - **Try-it** — every operation card gets a collapsible form prefilled with schema params; the Send button runs the request from the extension host (Node `fetch`) and shows status / headers / body in-place. Configure the default base URL via the new `contractkit.tryItOut.baseUrl` setting.
    - **Status bar** entry showing API title and counts, with a warning badge when the builder collects diagnostics.

    The rendering layer ships as a new `@contractkit/explorer-ui` package — pure HTML strings, themable via `--ce-*` CSS custom properties, no runtime dependency on `@contractkit/core` (types only). The package is consumed by the VS Code extension today and is structured for a future `@contractkit/plugin-explorer` static-site generator.
