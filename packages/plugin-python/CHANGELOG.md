- ca1c139: Declare the MIT license explicitly: every package now ships a `LICENSE` file in its published tarball and sets `"license": "MIT"` in its manifest, so license scanners and registries report the terms correctly.

### Minor Changes

- 85d7566: Let an operation emit more than one status, and a status serve more than one content type.

    A status code could previously declare only one mime — the parser warned `Duplicate response body` and dropped the rest — and the generated router pinned both `ctx.status` and `ctx.type` to whichever response happened to be listed first with a body. An endpoint serving several formats had to declare one lying mime and let browsers sniff, and a service had no way to say which status it produced.

    A status now holds every declared `mime: Type` line (`OpResponseNode.bodies`). When there is more than one, the service picks at runtime and the router sets `ctx.type` from the returned `contentType`. When an operation produces more than one status, the service returns a union discriminated on `status` and the handler switches on it, so each status writes only its own headers, mime and body. Both SDKs mirror the router: the TypeScript and Python clients return a matching union, report which mime came back, and pass the non-2xx statuses they expect to the shared fetch so a declared `304` no longer surfaces as an error. `SdkError` now takes a body type parameter, and each operation exports a `…ErrorBody` alias for the statuses that stay on the throw path.

    Which statuses the service produces is derived from the declaration: **a status is emitted if it has a block, or is 2xx.** An empty block (`304: {}`) says the service returns that status carrying nothing; a bare `304:` says it is documented and something else produces it. `404(documented): { … }` is the one modifier, forcing a block-carrying status back out.

    Two long-standing bugs in the same area go with it. The formatter deleted any comment written inside a `response` block — above a status code, above a mime line, above a `headers:` block, or before a closing brace — so `pnpm format` silently threw away the notes explaining why a contract looks the way it does; all four positions now round-trip. And the generated router declared a `_ZodBinary` helper for a binary _response_ body, which is a plain `Buffer` annotation with no schema behind it, leaving an unused const that tripped `noUnusedLocals` downstream; helpers are now chosen from the code that was actually generated, the same way imports already were.

    **If you are already on a pre-release version, two things change under you.** A contract that declares a body on an error status — `404: { application/json: Problem }` alongside a `200` — now returns it from the service instead of throwing, and the SDK return type becomes a union; add `(documented)` to that status to keep the previous behaviour. Contracts whose error statuses are bodyless (`400:`, `404:`) are unaffected. Anything reading the AST directly should move from `OpResponseNode.contentType`/`bodyType` to `bodies`, which replaces them.

### Patch Changes

- 2bf01f1: Split multi-line descriptions across `#` comment lines and escape `"""` in generated method docstrings so ordinary multi-line doc comments can no longer produce invalid Python. Render the `interval` scalar as `str` and throw on an unmapped scalar type instead of falling back to `Any`.

### Minor Changes

- 4ac6d4d: Move plugin incremental-build manifests under the CLI cache directory (default `.contractkit/cache/`, configurable via `config.cache.dir`). Bruno's `.contractkit-bruno-manifest.json` (in the bruno-collection dir), Python's `.contractkit-python-manifest.json` (in the python-sdk dir), and TypeScript's `.contractkit-typescript-manifest.json` (at rootDir) now all live as `bruno-manifest.json` / `python-manifest.json` / `typescript-manifest.json` under `ctx.cacheDir`, alongside the CLI's existing `build.json` and HTTP cache. Output dirs no longer contain build state.

    `PluginContext` gains a `cacheDir: string` field. `runIncrementalCodegen` no longer takes a `manifestFilename` argument and no longer bundles the manifest into `filesToWrite` — the result's `manifest` is returned separately so plugins can persist it wherever they want. New helper `serializeIncrementalManifest(manifest)` produces the JSON form.

    After upgrading, the old in-output manifests can be deleted manually (or with `--force`); plugins will simply do a full regen on the first run since they won't find a manifest at the new path.

### Minor Changes

- 10ca07b: Add per-output incremental caching to the Bruno, Python, and TypeScript plugins. Editing a single contract or operation no longer regenerates every output file — only the units whose transitive inputs actually changed are re-rendered, with the rest reused from a per-plugin manifest. `@contractkit/core` exposes the shared utility (`runIncrementalCodegen`, `parseIncrementalManifest`, `hashFingerprint`, `collectTransitiveModelRefs`, manifest types) for plugin authors. `PluginContext` gains a `cacheEnabled` flag so plugins can honor `--force` / `cache: false`.

### Patch Changes

- 9269093: chore: update dependencies across multiple projects

    This commit updates various dependencies in the package.json files for several projects, including:
    - Upgraded `@changesets/cli`, `@types/node`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `turbo`, and `typescript` to their latest versions.
    - Updated `@types/vscode`, `@vscode/vsce`, and `esbuild` in the vscode extension.
    - Adjusted `@scalar/openapi-parser` and `yaml` in the openapi-to-ck package.
    - Enhanced ESLint and TypeScript configurations in the config-eslint package.

    These updates improve compatibility and maintainability across the codebase.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bbee232: prep for public release

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bbee232]
    - @contractkit/core@0.10.0

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27b771: Add an `includeInternal: boolean` config option to every plugin so consumers can override whether `internal` operations are emitted. Defaults preserve today's behavior: server router and Bruno default to `true` (include); TS SDK, Python SDK, OpenAPI, and Markdown default to `false` (exclude).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d13614c: Enhance content type handling in contract DSL. This update introduces support for vendor JSON MIME types and improves the classification of content types, allowing for better handling of text and binary responses. The grammar has been updated to accept a wider range of MIME types, and tests have been added to ensure correct parsing and serialization behavior. Additionally, the code has been refactored to normalize content types for stable comparisons and to support multi-MIME request bodies.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d13614c]
    - @maroonedsoftware/contractkit@0.9.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 888ded5: Enhance contract DSL with multi-base inheritance support and override modifier. This update introduces the ability to declare multiple base contracts, along with validation rules for field conflicts across bases. The `override` modifier is now required for redeclaring conflicting fields, and the documentation has been updated to reflect these changes. Tests have been added to ensure correct behavior for inheritance and modifier usage.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [888ded5]
    - @maroonedsoftware/contractkit@0.8.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d42e39: Enhance Python and TypeScript SDKs to support typed response headers. Updated the Python client to generate `TypedDict` for response headers and modified return types accordingly. The TypeScript SDK now includes runtime assertions for required headers and documents them in the generated markdown. Tests were added to verify the correct handling of response headers in both SDKs.
