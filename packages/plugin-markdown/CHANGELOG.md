# @contractkit/contractkit-plugin-markdown

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- ba7d61b: Deprecated in favour of `@contractkit/plugin-docs`, which now emits these outputs as its `openapi`
  and `markdown` targets.

    Both packages are reduced to thin re-exports and keep working: every export, option name and
    generated file is unchanged, so existing configs continue to resolve. They will be removed in a
    future major.

    To migrate, move the entry under `@contractkit/plugin-docs` and keep the options as they are:

    ```json
    "@contractkit/plugin-docs": {
        "openapi": { "baseDir": "docs/api/", "output": "openapi.yaml" },
        "markdown": { "baseDir": "docs/", "output": "api-reference.md" }
    }
    ```

    `npm deprecate` must be run manually against both packages after this release publishes.

### Patch Changes

- ffb2ec6: Ship an `llms.txt` in every package, so an AI assistant reading the package out of `node_modules` gets its exact name, a config block with real key names, the full option table, the programmatic API, and the mistakes specific to it — without needing the repo checked out.

    Correct several documented snippets that could not work as written. The five plugin READMEs named packages that do not exist (`@contractkit/contractkit-plugin-*`, and `-python-sdk` for the Python plugin) in both their install commands and their `contractkit.config.json` keys. `@contractkit/core`'s README exported `Diagnostics` and `validateOperation`, which are really `DiagnosticCollector` and `validateOp`, and gave the wrong signatures for three validation passes. `@contractkit/cli`'s README documented the OpenAPI importer as `contractkit openapi-to-ck --input <spec>`; it is `contractkit import-openapi <spec>`, with the path positional. `@contractkit/plugin-openapi` described its output as OpenAPI 3.0, but it emits 3.1.

### Minor Changes

- e102a2c: Add a `decimal` scalar, for money and anything else that has to be exact

    `number` compiles to `z.coerce.number()` — an IEEE-754 double. Anything monetary has to be exact,
    so contracts either lied about their types or routed the value through `string` by hand. `decimal`
    gives the language a type for it:

    ```
    contract Payslip: {
        gross: decimal(min=0, scale=2)
        rate: decimal
    }
    ```

    A decimal travels as a **quoted JSON string** (`{"gross": "1250.00"}`) and becomes a decimal.js
    `Decimal` — the same class Prisma hands you for a `Decimal` column, so a value moves between the
    two with no conversion. Python gets `decimal.Decimal`; OpenAPI gets `type: string, format: decimal`.

    A raw JSON number is **rejected**, not coerced. By the time one reaches the schema it has already
    been through a double, which is precisely the loss the scalar exists to prevent, so accepting it
    would defeat the point silently.

    **`scale=` is a validation constraint — at most N decimal places — not a formatting directive.**
    It cannot be one: the router assigns `ctx.body` and Koa serializes it with a `JSON.stringify` we
    have no replacer for, so the wire form is whatever decimal.js normalizes to and `"1250.00"` reads
    back as `"1250"`. The two are the same number; format at the display edge if you need the trailing
    zeros. This is also what `scale` means in OpenAPI `pattern`, pydantic `condecimal(decimal_places=)`
    and Prisma `@db.Decimal(_, n)`, so every downstream mapping stays honest.

    Generated code sets `Decimal.set({ toExpNeg: -9e15, toExpPos: 9e15 })` so values never serialize in
    exponential notation — without it `0.00000001` ships as `"1e-8"` and any peer validating
    `^-?\d+(\.\d+)?$` rejects it. Note this is global decimal.js configuration and affects every
    `Decimal` in the consuming process.

    SDK clients rehydrate decimals through generated `reviveX` functions. The `bigint` approach does
    not transfer — it works only because bigint invented a tagged `"123n"` wire encoding, and tagging a
    decimal would corrupt the format for every non-ContractKit consumer. Re-parsing responses through
    the Zod schema is not available either: `XOutput` is a type alias with no runtime value, and models
    default to `z.strictObject`, so any field the server added would throw in every deployed client.
    The revivers mutate in place, which preserves unknown server-added keys.

    Two placements are rejected at parse time, both errors rather than warnings since no existing
    contract can be relying on them. A decimal inside an **undiscriminated union** cannot be rehydrated
    — the SDK has no way to tell which arm arrived, and a convert-if-string fallback would silently
    rewrite a genuine `string` field in a sibling arm. A decimal in a **response header** has no
    parsing step at all, so the annotation would simply be false at runtime.

    `min`/`max` are kept as exact decimal strings rather than coerced through `Number()`, and OpenAPI
    carries them in `x-contractkit-min`/`-max` extensions, since JSON Schema's numeric `minimum` and
    `maximum` are ignored on a string type. A contract round-trips through OpenAPI and back with its
    bounds intact.

    SDKs that scaffold a `package.json` gain `decimal.js` as a dependency when a covered model uses the
    scalar. Existing scaffolds are write-once and are not updated, so add it by hand there.

### Minor Changes

- 85d7566: Let an operation emit more than one status, and a status serve more than one content type.

    A status code could previously declare only one mime — the parser warned `Duplicate response body` and dropped the rest — and the generated router pinned both `ctx.status` and `ctx.type` to whichever response happened to be listed first with a body. An endpoint serving several formats had to declare one lying mime and let browsers sniff, and a service had no way to say which status it produced.

    A status now holds every declared `mime: Type` line (`OpResponseNode.bodies`). When there is more than one, the service picks at runtime and the router sets `ctx.type` from the returned `contentType`. When an operation produces more than one status, the service returns a union discriminated on `status` and the handler switches on it, so each status writes only its own headers, mime and body. Both SDKs mirror the router: the TypeScript and Python clients return a matching union, report which mime came back, and pass the non-2xx statuses they expect to the shared fetch so a declared `304` no longer surfaces as an error. `SdkError` now takes a body type parameter, and each operation exports a `…ErrorBody` alias for the statuses that stay on the throw path.

    Which statuses the service produces is derived from the declaration: **a status is emitted if it has a block, or is 2xx.** An empty block (`304: {}`) says the service returns that status carrying nothing; a bare `304:` says it is documented and something else produces it. `404(documented): { … }` is the one modifier, forcing a block-carrying status back out.

    Two long-standing bugs in the same area go with it. The formatter deleted any comment written inside a `response` block — above a status code, above a mime line, above a `headers:` block, or before a closing brace — so `pnpm format` silently threw away the notes explaining why a contract looks the way it does; all four positions now round-trip. And the generated router declared a `_ZodBinary` helper for a binary _response_ body, which is a plain `Buffer` annotation with no schema behind it, leaving an unused const that tripped `noUnusedLocals` downstream; helpers are now chosen from the code that was actually generated, the same way imports already were.

    **If you are already on a pre-release version, two things change under you.** A contract that declares a body on an error status — `404: { application/json: Problem }` alongside a `200` — now returns it from the service instead of throwing, and the SDK return type becomes a union; add `(documented)` to that status to keep the previous behaviour. Contracts whose error statuses are bodyless (`400:`, `404:`) are unaffected. Anything reading the AST directly should move from `OpResponseNode.contentType`/`bodyType` to `bodies`, which replaces them.

- fff30df: Add a block form to the operation `signature:` key. Alongside the existing bare form (`signature: KEY`), you can now write `signature: { options: KEY, policy: name }` to attach a signature-scoped policy. The policy is passed through to the generated `requireSignature(KEY, { policy: name })` middleware and surfaces in OpenAPI-to-`.ck` output, Markdown docs, and the explorer UI. The bare form is unchanged and remains shorthand for a block with only `options:`.

### Minor Changes

- dd8197b: **Breaking:** Replace the `requireMfa: boolean` field in `security: { ... }` blocks with `policy: <ident|none>`, and switch the generated Koa router middleware from `requireSecurity` to ServerKit's new `requirePolicy`.

    The `security` declaration on operations, routes, and the file-level `options { security: { ... } }` block no longer accepts a `requireMfa:` line. The new field is `policy:` and takes a bare identifier (the named policy) or the keyword `none` to explicitly bypass policy enforcement. Existing `.ck` files that use `requireMfa:` will fail to parse.

    ```ck
    # Before
    security: {
        requireMfa: true
    }

    # After
    security: {
        policy: paymentsWrite
    }

    # Explicit bypass
    security: {
        policy: none
    }
    ```

    **`@contractkit/core`** — `SecurityFields` interface drops `requireMfa` / `requireMfaDescription` and adds `policy?: string | false` / `policyDescription?: string`. The grammar's `SecurityRequireMfaLine` is replaced by `SecurityPolicyLine` (`policyKw ":" (noneKw | identifier)`). `security: none` (the route-level public sentinel) is unchanged.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-typescript`** — Generated Koa routers now import `requirePolicy` from `@maroonedsoftware/koa` (previously `requireSecurity`) and emit `requirePolicy({ policy: 'name' })`, `requirePolicy({ policy: false })`, or bare `requirePolicy()`. Consumers must upgrade ServerKit alongside.

    **`@contractkit/prettier-plugin`** — Formats `policy: <name>` and `policy: none` lines inside security blocks. Files containing `requireMfa:` will no longer round-trip and will surface as parse errors.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-markdown`** — The "Security: authenticated" admonition now shows `policy: <name|none>` instead of `requireMfa: <bool>`.

    **`@contractkit/openapi-to-ck`** — Non-empty OpenAPI `security` requirements continue to collapse to an empty `security: {}` (authenticated, default policy); the serializer now emits `policy:` lines when the field is set.

    **`contractkit-vscode-extension`** — TextMate grammar highlights `policy:` inside the security block; LSP completion offers `policy` instead of `requireMfa`. Re-run `pnpm run vscode:install` to pick up the change.

## 0.8.8

### Patch Changes

- 79af33b: **Breaking:** Replace the `roles` field in `security: { ... }` blocks with `requireMfa: boolean`.

    The `security` declaration on operations, routes, and the file-level `options { security: { ... } }` block no longer accepts a `roles:` line. The new field is `requireMfa: true | false`. Existing `.ck` files that use `roles:` will fail to parse.

    ```ck
    # Before
    security: {
        roles: admin editor
    }

    # After
    security: {
        requireMfa: true
    }
    ```

    **`@contractkit/core`** — `SecurityFields` interface drops `roles` / `rolesDescription` and adds `requireMfa` / `requireMfaDescription`. The grammar's `SecurityRolesLine` is replaced by `SecurityRequireMfaLine` (`requireMfaKw ":" booleanLit`). `security: none` continues to work.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-typescript`** — Generated Koa routers now emit `requireSecurity({ requireMfa: <bool> })` when `requireMfa` is set, and bare `requireSecurity()` for unannotated routes (previously `requireSecurity({ roles: [...] })` / `requireSecurity({  })`). The generated code matches the updated serverkit `SecurityOptions = { requireMfa: boolean }` signature; consumers must upgrade serverkit alongside.

    **`@contractkit/prettier-plugin`** — Formats `requireMfa: true|false` lines inside security blocks. Files containing `roles:` will no longer round-trip and will surface as parse errors.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-markdown`** — The "Security: authenticated" admonition now shows `requireMfa: <bool>` instead of `roles: <list>`.

    **`@contractkit/openapi-to-ck`** — `convertSecurity` no longer extracts OpenAPI scopes into a `roles` list (those don't map onto MFA semantics). Any non-empty OpenAPI `security` requirement now collapses to `security: {}` (authenticated, no MFA flag).
