### Minor Changes

- 85d7566: Let an operation emit more than one status, and a status serve more than one content type.

    A status code could previously declare only one mime — the parser warned `Duplicate response body` and dropped the rest — and the generated router pinned both `ctx.status` and `ctx.type` to whichever response happened to be listed first with a body. An endpoint serving several formats had to declare one lying mime and let browsers sniff, and a service had no way to say which status it produced.

    A status now holds every declared `mime: Type` line (`OpResponseNode.bodies`). When there is more than one, the service picks at runtime and the router sets `ctx.type` from the returned `contentType`. When an operation produces more than one status, the service returns a union discriminated on `status` and the handler switches on it, so each status writes only its own headers, mime and body. Both SDKs mirror the router: the TypeScript and Python clients return a matching union, report which mime came back, and pass the non-2xx statuses they expect to the shared fetch so a declared `304` no longer surfaces as an error. `SdkError` now takes a body type parameter, and each operation exports a `…ErrorBody` alias for the statuses that stay on the throw path.

    Which statuses the service produces is derived from the declaration: **a status is emitted if it has a block, or is 2xx.** An empty block (`304: {}`) says the service returns that status carrying nothing; a bare `304:` says it is documented and something else produces it. `404(documented): { … }` is the one modifier, forcing a block-carrying status back out.

    Two long-standing bugs in the same area go with it. The formatter deleted any comment written inside a `response` block — above a status code, above a mime line, above a `headers:` block, or before a closing brace — so `pnpm format` silently threw away the notes explaining why a contract looks the way it does; all four positions now round-trip. And the generated router declared a `_ZodBinary` helper for a binary _response_ body, which is a plain `Buffer` annotation with no schema behind it, leaving an unused const that tripped `noUnusedLocals` downstream; helpers are now chosen from the code that was actually generated, the same way imports already were.

    **If you are already on a pre-release version, two things change under you.** A contract that declares a body on an error status — `404: { application/json: Problem }` alongside a `200` — now returns it from the service instead of throwing, and the SDK return type becomes a union; add `(documented)` to that status to keep the previous behaviour. Contracts whose error statuses are bodyless (`400:`, `404:`) are unaffected. Anything reading the AST directly should move from `OpResponseNode.contentType`/`bodyType` to `bodies`, which replaces them.

- 2bf01f1: Flatten multi-line descriptions into single-line trailing comments and quote enum values containing spaces or other non-identifier characters, so `.ck` generated from real-world OpenAPI specs re-parses cleanly.

### Minor Changes

- fff30df: Add a block form to the operation `signature:` key. Alongside the existing bare form (`signature: KEY`), you can now write `signature: { options: KEY, policy: name }` to attach a signature-scoped policy. The policy is passed through to the generated `requireSignature(KEY, { policy: name })` middleware and surfaces in OpenAPI-to-`.ck` output, Markdown docs, and the explorer UI. The bare form is unchanged and remains shorthand for a block with only `options:`.

### Minor Changes

- dd8197b: **Breaking:** Replace the `requireMfa: boolean` field in `security: { ... }` blocks with `policy: <ident|none>`, and switch the generated Koa router middleware from `requireSecurity` to ServerKit's new `requirePolicy`.

    The `security` declaration on operations, routes, and the file-level `options { security: { ... } }` block no longer accepts a `requireMfa:` line. The new field is `policy:` and takes a bare identifier (the named policy) or the keyword `none` to explicitly bypass policy enforcement. Existing `.ck` files that use `requireMfa:` will fail to parse.

    ```ck
    # Before
    security: {
        requireMfa: true
    }

    # After
    security: {
        policy: paymentsWrite
    }

    # Explicit bypass
    security: {
        policy: none
    }
    ```

    **`@contractkit/core`** — `SecurityFields` interface drops `requireMfa` / `requireMfaDescription` and adds `policy?: string | false` / `policyDescription?: string`. The grammar's `SecurityRequireMfaLine` is replaced by `SecurityPolicyLine` (`policyKw ":" (noneKw | identifier)`). `security: none` (the route-level public sentinel) is unchanged.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-typescript`** — Generated Koa routers now import `requirePolicy` from `@maroonedsoftware/koa` (previously `requireSecurity`) and emit `requirePolicy({ policy: 'name' })`, `requirePolicy({ policy: false })`, or bare `requirePolicy()`. Consumers must upgrade ServerKit alongside.

    **`@contractkit/prettier-plugin`** — Formats `policy: <name>` and `policy: none` lines inside security blocks. Files containing `requireMfa:` will no longer round-trip and will surface as parse errors.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-markdown`** — The "Security: authenticated" admonition now shows `policy: <name|none>` instead of `requireMfa: <bool>`.

    **`@contractkit/openapi-to-ck`** — Non-empty OpenAPI `security` requirements continue to collapse to an empty `security: {}` (authenticated, default policy); the serializer now emits `policy:` lines when the field is set.

    **`contractkit-vscode-extension`** — TextMate grammar highlights `policy:` inside the security block; LSP completion offers `policy` instead of `requireMfa`. Re-run `pnpm run vscode:install` to pick up the change.

### Patch Changes

- 79af33b: **Breaking:** Replace the `roles` field in `security: { ... }` blocks with `requireMfa: boolean`.

    The `security` declaration on operations, routes, and the file-level `options { security: { ... } }` block no longer accepts a `roles:` line. The new field is `requireMfa: true | false`. Existing `.ck` files that use `roles:` will fail to parse.

    ```ck
    # Before
    security: {
        roles: admin editor
    }

    # After
    security: {
        requireMfa: true
    }
    ```

    **`@contractkit/core`** — `SecurityFields` interface drops `roles` / `rolesDescription` and adds `requireMfa` / `requireMfaDescription`. The grammar's `SecurityRolesLine` is replaced by `SecurityRequireMfaLine` (`requireMfaKw ":" booleanLit`). `security: none` continues to work.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-typescript`** — Generated Koa routers now emit `requireSecurity({ requireMfa: <bool> })` when `requireMfa` is set, and bare `requireSecurity()` for unannotated routes (previously `requireSecurity({ roles: [...] })` / `requireSecurity({  })`). The generated code matches the updated serverkit `SecurityOptions = { requireMfa: boolean }` signature; consumers must upgrade serverkit alongside.

    **`@contractkit/prettier-plugin`** — Formats `requireMfa: true|false` lines inside security blocks. Files containing `roles:` will no longer round-trip and will surface as parse errors.

    **`@contractkit/plugin-markdown`** — The "Security: authenticated" admonition now shows `requireMfa: <bool>` instead of `roles: <list>`.

    **`@contractkit/openapi-to-ck`** — `convertSecurity` no longer extracts OpenAPI scopes into a `roles` list (those don't map onto MFA semantics). Any non-empty OpenAPI `security` requirement now collapses to `security: {}` (authenticated, no MFA flag).

- 9269093: chore: update dependencies across multiple projects

    This commit updates various dependencies in the package.json files for several projects, including:
    - Upgraded `@changesets/cli`, `@types/node`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `turbo`, and `typescript` to their latest versions.
    - Updated `@types/vscode`, `@vscode/vsce`, and `esbuild` in the vscode extension.
    - Adjusted `@scalar/openapi-parser` and `yaml` in the openapi-to-ck package.
    - Enhanced ESLint and TypeScript configurations in the config-eslint package.

    These updates improve compatibility and maintainability across the codebase.

- 888ded5: Enhance contract DSL with multi-base inheritance support and override modifier. This update introduces the ability to declare multiple base contracts, along with validation rules for field conflicts across bases.
