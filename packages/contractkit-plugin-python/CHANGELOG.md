## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d42e39: Enhance Python and TypeScript SDKs to support typed response headers. Updated the Python client to generate `TypedDict` for response headers and modified return types accordingly.

Tests were added to verify the correct handling of response headers in both SDKs.
